# Backend server using Python 
I have python 3.8 installed on my machine, so it's good to have the new version installed

the steps i followed are in the this video set [link to linden videos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/full-stack-web-development-with-flask/setting-up-the-virtual-environment-and-framework?autoplay=true&u=2152804)

# Make sure to install pip 
It's most likely installed with python 3.8, but to make sure it's installed --> **py -m pip --version**

# Install the package that i have already set for this project 
 - Do **pip install -r requirements.txt** file for all the needed modules. or **py -m pip install -r requirements.txt**
 - then active the development enviornment that we need to do the work there by this command **backend-python\Scripts\activate**
 - When the work is done run this command **deactivate**
__working in the develment is a good practice for now__
